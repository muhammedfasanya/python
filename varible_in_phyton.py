# Variables vary. They can change. They make our lives easier.

# I like to think of variables as a container used to store specific objects. The objects are
# known as data, and the variables holds data.

# Variable Declaration

first_name = "bwave"  #text string

last_name = "bwave"   #text string

age = 10  #number int

score = 45.7  #floa
developer = True  #boolean

question = 60 > 10

# calling the variables

print(question)

print(score + 4)

# print(last_name + 4)
