#Arithmetic Operations in Python
#Wrrite a pthon code for each of these and include the output

#Exercise 1: Calculate the result of 24 + 16 - 5
#Solution:24+16-5
# 35

#Exercise 2: Multiply 12 by 9 and divide the result by 3
#Solution:12*9/3
#  36

#Exercise 3: Find the remainder when 89 is divided by 6
#Solution: 86%6
# 5

#Exercise 4: Perform floor division of 125 by 8
#Solution: # 125//8
# 5

#Exercise 5: Calculate 4 raised to the power of 5
#Solution:4**5
# 1024
#Exercise 6: Evaluate: 20 + 15 * 2 - 10
#Solution:  20 + 15 * 2 - 10
# 40

#Exercise 7: Evaluate using parentheses: (20 + 15) * (2 - 1)
#Solution: (20 + 15) * (2 - 1)
#  35

#Exercise 8: Convert 135 minutes into hours and minutes
#Solution: 135//60 gives you 2
#Solution:  135%60 gives you 15
#Solution:So, 135 minutes = 2 hours and 15 minutes

#Exercise 9: Find the average of 10, 20, and 30
#Average: 20.0

#Exercise 10:You have 535 seconds. Use Python arithmetic to convert this into minutes and remaining seconds.
#Hint: Use // for the minutes and % for the remaining seconds.
#Solution:  535 // 60 = 8
#Solution:  535 % 60 = 55
#Solution:So, 535 seconds = 8 minutes and 55 seconds
